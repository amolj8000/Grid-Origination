# Grid Origination Intelligence Platform

## Platform Purpose & Business Context

This is a **power market siting and PPA origination intelligence tool** built for Walmart's energy procurement team. It serves two primary use cases:

### Use Case 1 — PPA / Offtake Origination
Identify renewable energy projects (wind, solar, storage) from the EIA 860 database that can enter into Power Purchase Agreements or offtake contracts with Walmart to hedge a portion of their electricity portfolio across ERCOT, CAISO, and PJM.

Workflow: Pull EIA 860 projects → Show on Map → Screen by filters → Score on 10 risk dimensions → Rank → Export for deal team.

**10 scoring dimensions:** congestion risk, curtailment risk, basis risk, tax credit eligibility, sponsor quality, contract structure, market type, capacity available, delivery profile, confidence score.

### Use Case 2 — New Project Siting via Queue Analysis
Analyze the interconnection queue to find regions where a new greenfield project could be sited with acceptable queue position, limited congestion/curtailment competition, and favorable basis. Some areas already have heavy pipeline; others represent opportunity.

Workflow: Review queue depth by region → Overlay congestion analysis → Cross-reference existing project density → Assess basis risk via nodal history → Rank candidate zones.

### Q&A Copilot
The Q&A Copilot should eventually answer natural-language questions about the platform data. It needs to be connected to the full DB and OpenAI for structured SQL + RAG responses. Questions like "Which ERCOT wind projects have the lowest congestion risk?" or "What is the queue depth in LZ_WEST for 2025?"

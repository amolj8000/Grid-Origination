            This is a standalone analytics platform for the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO)
            market — Canada's only competitive energy-only wholesale electricity market. It tracks
            pool price, generation mix, supply/demand, outages, forward capability, the interconnection
            queue, and reliability adequacy metrics, all from real AESO public data sources.

            A second focus is Alberta's market transition: AESO is moving from a single system-wide
            pool price to a Restructured Energy Market (REM) with locational marginal pricing, expected
            mid-2027. The Congestion &amp; Nodal Analysis and REM tabs model and explain that transition.

# Grid Intelligence — Technical Notes & Hard-Won Lessons

Detailed technical narrative of key implementation challenges solved during Replit development.
Use this as ground truth when making architectural decisions or debugging data issues.

**Last updated:** July 2026 (corrections applied post-Replit)

---

## 0. General Engineering Principles

### Python venv — confirmed installed packages (pypsa-engine .venv, Python 3.13)
The pypsa venv at `artifacts/pypsa-engine/.venv` runs Python 3.13 (installed via deadsnakes PPA on the Azure VM). Confirmed installed:
```
gridstatus          # ERCOT/CAISO/PJM API client
psycopg2-binary     # PostgreSQL driver
numpy pandas scipy  # scientific stack (pandas kept as gridstatus return type)
polars              # primary DataFrame library for all seeders — faster, less RAM
duckdb              # in-process OLAP SQL engine
requests            # HTTP
```
Install command for any missing package:
```bash
~/grid-intelligence/artifacts/pypsa-engine/.venv/bin/pip install <pkg>
```

### Use Polars, not Pandas, for large datasets
Switch all Python seeders and data processing to **Polars** — faster, more memory-efficient, better for bulk operations on 10k–1M+ row datasets. Pandas stays as a fallback only where a library (e.g. gridstatus) requires it.

### Data vintage: use 2025/2026 reports, not 2024
Any reference data from EIA, NREL ATB, ERCOT LTSA, CBRE, etc. should use **2025 or 2026 reports**. The 2024 versions used in Replit are now stale. Update report references during migration.

### Seed verification at seed time
**Every seeder must verify its own output immediately after running.** Don't wait until later — after a week you won't remember what was seeded or whether it was complete. Each seeder should finish with a verification query that checks:
- Row count matches expected range
- No null values in critical columns
- Date/time coverage is complete (no missing months/days)
- Sample spot-check: pull 3–5 known rows and compare against source

### Data strategy: 2025+2026 primary, 2024 optional backfill
Applied uniformly across all datasets:
- **SCED dispatch:** 2025+2026 primary; 2024 backfill is optional (run `seed-on-aws.sh --year 2024` separately)
- **DA/RT nodal/zonal/hub (ERCOT + CAISO):** 2025+2026 primary; 2024 backfill optional. **If data exists from Replit, migrate it rather than re-seeding.**
- Replit data migration takes precedence over re-seeding — avoids redundant API calls and preserves any historical data within the 60-day SCED window.

## 1. DA/RT Nodal Price Data at Scale — ZIP64 Parsing & Bundle Architecture

**ERCOT reports:** CDR 13060 (DAM), 13061 (RTM) — annual ZIP64 archives, 200–400 MB compressed.

**Root cause of failures:** ZIP64 uses 64-bit offsets; most Node.js ZIP libraries only read 32-bit fields.
When uncompressed > 4 GB, local header offset = `0xFFFFFFFF` (sentinel). Libraries fall back to wrong offsets → truncated output or "central directory not found".

**Fix:** Custom Node.js ZIP64 extractor — reads from central directory at end of archive (not local headers).
Algorithm: seek to EOCD record → parse ZIP64 EOCD locator → walk central directory entries → use 64-bit offsets to extract. Extracted XLSX piped into `xlsx` for parsing.
**Do not replace this with a ZIP library — they will silently fail on ERCOT's files.**

**CAISO ZIP quirk:** OASIS ATL_PNODE_MAP uses streaming ZIP with `compSize=0` in local headers — same central-directory parsing trick applies.

**Resource node scale (1,100+ nodes):**
- CDR NP6-905-cd (RT), NP4-190-cd (DA) — monthly ZIP bundles, one CSV per month, ~27k rows/month
- Upsert on `(node, year, month)` with unique constraint — idempotent, restartable
- Page size: 100k rows per API call from ERCOT bundle endpoint
- Python + psycopg2 `execute_values` with `page_size=5000` — ~10× faster than ORM inserts (switch inner processing to Polars)
- Gap-fill detection: `COUNT(DISTINCT node) < 900` = incomplete month → re-pull
- Total: 27,193 rows in `ercot_node_stats`, 28 months × 1,108 real resource nodes

**Verification query after seeding:**
```sql
SELECT year, month, COUNT(DISTINCT node) nodes, COUNT(*) rows
FROM ercot_node_stats
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;
-- Expect: ~1,108 nodes per month, ~27k rows per month
```

---

## 2. SCED Dispatch — The 60-Day Window Problem

**ERCOT NP3-965-ER (60-Day SCED Disclosure):** Rolling window — only last 60 days publicly available.

**Silent failure mode:** `gridstatus.get_60_day_sced_disclosure()` for dates > 60 days old returns empty DataFrame silently (no error, zero rows). Seeder "succeeds", logs `rows_inserted = 0`, moves on.
→ Thousands of log entries all showing 0 rows before detection.

**Detection fix:** If seeded date has `rows_inserted < 100`, flag as failed, don't mark complete.

**Gap-fill architecture:**
1. On PyPSA engine startup, spawn daemon thread
2. Query `ercot_dispatch_seed_log` for dates in [Jan 2025, today−60d] with `rows_inserted = 0` or missing
3. For pre-window dates: attempt API, expect zero rows, log as "pre-window, unavailable"
4. For within-60-day window: fetch and insert real data
5. Status via `GET /pypsa/admin/seed-dispatch-status`

**Memory profile:** ~60k–80k rows raw per day (5-min SCED, all resources) → ~16k–19k after hourly aggregation. Peak RSS: 150–200 MB per iteration. Single-threaded by design — parallel fetching would OOM. Use Polars for aggregation step.

**Seeding strategy on AWS:**
- Phase A: 2025-01-01 → today (within/near 60-day window — gets real data)
- Phase B (optional): 2024 backfill — run separately; pre-window dates log as unavailable, not errors

---

## 3. ERCOT & CAISO Public APIs — What's Actually Usable

### ERCOT (no auth for most)
- **CDR 13060/13061**: `misdownload/servlets/mirDownload?doclookupId=...` — direct HTTPS, no token. `doclookupId` per year is static, must be discovered manually from CDR index.
- **NP6-905-cd / NP4-190-cd**: `pubapi.ercot.com/api/2.0/dataproduct/downloadFile` — rate-limits aggressively; add exponential backoff with jitter.
- **CDR 10008 (CRITICAL)**: Bus/node location mapping CSV — bus name → zone → lat/lon. 1,108 resource nodes geocoded. This is the source of truth for all geo-spatial mapping. Must be re-pulled fresh if ERCOT updates it (bus retirements/additions happen annually). Also used for Tier-2 PyPSA bus coordinates.
- **B2C OAuth** (`B2C_1_PUBAPI-ROPC-FLOW`): client credentials → Bearer token via `login.microsoftonline.com`. `ERCOT_CLIENT_ID` + `ERCOT_PASSWORD`.
- **Gotcha:** NP6-345-CD (load by weather zone) returns HTTP 404 even with valid Bearer token — ERCOT removed public access. Use EIA-930 instead.

### CAISO (no auth)
- **OASIS PRC_LMP** (`oasis.caiso.com/oasisapi/SingleZip`): ZIP containing XML, hourly DA LMP. Params: `queryname=PRC_LMP`, `market_run_id=DAM`, `node=TH_SP15_GEN-APND`.
- **Critical limit:** Max 31-day date range per request. Wider range → 114-byte empty ZIP (silent, not an error). Detect by checking response size < 500 bytes.
- **OASIS PRC_HASP_LMP**: Real-time HASP prices. SP15/NP15/ZP26 only; granular nodes need market participant credentials.
- **OASIS ATL_PNODE_MAP**: 1,774 pricing nodes with lat/lon. Streaming ZIP with `compSize=0` — use central-directory parser.

### EIA-930 (free key required)
- `api.eia.gov/v2/electricity/rto/region-sub-ba-data/data/` with `facets[parent][]=ERCO` → 8 ERCOT sub-BA load zones hourly
- `api.eia.gov/v2/electricity/rto/fuel-type-data/data/` with `facets[respondent][]=ERCO` → hourly fuel mix
- Pagination: `offset` + `length`, 5000-row pages
- **Gotcha:** Electricity scope key returns 403 on `v2/natural-gas/*`
- **Report vintage:** Use 2025/2026 EIA AEO and Form 860 — not 2024

### FRED (no key)
- `api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=DHHNGSP` → Henry Hub daily spot prices
- Holiday dates return `value: "."` — forward-fill from prior trading day

## 4. Transmission Lines & Bus Geo-Location (CRITICAL)

**This data underpins PyPSA Tier-2, the map layer, nodal congestion, and shift factors. Must be flawless.**

- **CDR 10008 (ERCOT):** Primary source for 1,108+ bus lat/lon, zone assignment, bus name. Re-pull annually or after any ERCOT topology update.
- **HIFLD Transmission Lines:** Source for the 345kV topology used in Tier-2 (340-bus network). Cross-reference against ERCOT's own TARA/topology files where possible.
- **Bus shift factors:** Used for all bus-level LMP calculations. ERCOT publishes shift factors — use the official ERCOT published values, not just the B-matrix re-implementation (which is a fallback). Always verify that shift factors sum correctly across buses.
- **Re-implementation of PTDF (PyPSA 1.x removed `calculate_PTDF()`):**
  `Bf = incidence_matrix @ diag(susceptances)`, `B = Bf @ Bf.T`, `PTDF = inv(B) @ Bf`
  Haversine nearest-neighbor maps each 345kV bus → EIA sub-BA zone centroid.

**Verification:** After seeding transmission/bus data, run a sanity check:
- All buses in `ercot_buses` should have non-null lat/lon
- Every settlement point node should map to exactly one bus (no orphans)
- Shift factor matrix should be rank = N_buses − 1 (one slack bus)

---

## 5. PyPSA Engine — Tier Architecture & Critical Bugs

**Architecture:** Standalone FastAPI (Uvicorn, port 8083). Node API reverse-proxies `/pypsa/*`. OPF solves take 2–10s. Long-running process — NOT Lambda-compatible. Runs via PM2 on EC2.

**PyPSA data quality standard: FLAWLESS.** Every input dataset (bus locations, line susceptances, generator capacities, load profiles) must be verified before running any OPF. A wrong impedance value or missing bus silently produces wrong LMPs.

**Two-tier network:**
- **Tier 1 (5-bus):** Abstract ERCOT with 5 buses mapped to real load zones (NORTH, HOUSTON, SOUTH, WEST, PANHANDLE). Fast (<1s), used for all user-facing scenario simulators.
- **Tier 2 (340-bus):** Full ERCOT 345kV topology from HIFLD + CDR 10008. DC OPF (B-matrix). Used for nodal congestion analysis and PTDF shift factors.

**CRITICAL BUG — Tier isolation:**
`simulators.py` must always call `_build_tier1()` directly — NEVER `build_network()`.
`build_network()` routes to Tier-2 if topology data is in DB. Tier-2 bus names don't match short names ("NORTH_WIND", "SOUTH_SOLAR") → 100% curtailment on every scenario. This bug will silently return wrong results.

**OPF Infeasibility:**
HiGHS doesn't raise exception on infeasible OPF — returns silently.
Detection: check `net.buses_t.marginal_price.empty` — if True, solve failed.
Fix: add "emergency peaker" generators at every bus (very high cost, unlimited capacity) — prevents infeasibility, shows very high LMPs instead.

### 5a. LMP / Nodal Pricing Methodology — What PyPSA Computes vs What ERCOT Publishes

**This is the single most important distinction to keep straight, and the easiest to get wrong when explaining basis risk to the deal team. PyPSA prices and ERCOT published prices are two different things and must never be conflated.**

**How PyPSA computes bus-level LMP (`network.py::run_opf`, `aeso_network.py::run_opf`):**
PyPSA solves a linearized DC optimal power flow (`n.optimize(solver_name="highs")`) that minimizes total generation cost (`Σ dispatch_MW × marginal_cost`) subject to nodal power balance, generator capacity limits (`p_nom × p_max_pu`), and line thermal limits (`s_nom`). The **LMP at each bus is read directly off `n.buses_t.marginal_price`** — this is the KKT dual variable (shadow price) of that bus's power-balance constraint. Code: `float(n.buses_t.marginal_price.get(bus_id, ...))`, rounded to 2 dp (ERCOT) / 4 dp (AESO).

**So PyPSA's LMP *is* the textbook decomposition** `LMP = energy (system λ) + congestion (Σ shift_factor × constraint shadow price)`. The congestion component is not computed by hand — it falls out of the LP duals automatically when a line constraint binds. This is exactly the "shift factors + shadow prices" mechanism ChatGPT described, and it's correct **for the congestion component only**.

**What drives the numbers (inputs, `network.py`):**
- **Merit order** = generator `marginal_cost`. Gas is heat-rate-derived: `HEAT_RATE_CC/1000 × gas_price` (CC 7,500; CT 10,000 Btu/kWh). Renewables/nuclear/hydro/storage use `BASE_MC` (wind/solar = $0, nuclear $5, hydro $2, peaker $499). Scarcity peaker cost = VOLL when passed.
- **Bus loads** (Tier 2) assigned in priority order: (1) **PTDF shift factors × EIA zone loads** (`ercot_bus_shift_factors` table) — `load_mw[bus] = zone_load_mw[eia_zone] × shift_factor[bus]`; (2) capacity-weighted fallback within LZ zone.
- **Historical mode:** when `simulation_datetime` is passed, real EIA-930 zone loads, fuel-mix-derived wind/solar CFs, and Henry Hub gas price override the synthetic params. Otherwise synthetic.
- **Line susceptance** (`x_pu`) sets the B-matrix that determines shift factors — a wrong impedance silently produces wrong congestion prices.

**What PyPSA does NOT model (why it ≠ ERCOT published prices):**
- **No price adders.** ERCOT RT LMPs exclude RT price adders (RTORPA/RTORDPA); the *settlement point prices* you seed (NP6-905) can include them. PyPSA has neither.
- **No settlement-point ↔ bus heuristic mapping.** ERCOT maps electrical-bus LMPs to published settlement points via heuristic pricing associations (see "Electrical Bus Mapping for Heuristic Pricing"). PyPSA emits raw modeled-bus prices with no such layer.
- **Reduced network.** Tier 2 is ~340 real 345 kV buses + k-NN graph; ERCOT's production model has thousands of buses. Topology, contingencies (N-1), and constraints differ.
- **Different objective.** ERCOT's SCED uses a two-step LMP methodology with its own constraint set; PyPSA is a single-period cost-minimizing DC OPF.

**Practical rule for the platform:**
- **Historical nodal prices (seeded from NP4-190 DA / NP6-905 RT)** = ground truth. Use for all customer-facing scoring, capture price, basis/congestion analysis, NPV inputs.
- **PyPSA LMPs** = forward-looking / counterfactual scenarios only (new line built, plant retires, load growth, curtailment sweeps). ERCOT historical prices can *calibrate/validate* PyPSA but PyPSA output must never be presented as actuals.
- When a page shows both, label clearly which is modeled vs actual. Basis risk shown to the deal team should always be derived from seeded historical nodal-vs-hub spreads, not PyPSA.

**Reference table worth seeding:** NP4-160-SG (Settlement Points List & Electrical Bus Mapping) gives the authoritative ~1,100 settlement-point universe and their bus mapping — useful for joining PyPSA buses to the seeded price nodes. Note it is the *market settlement-point* universe, not a dump of every physical network bus.

## 6. Candidate Rankings — 8-Dimension Scoring, 6 Investment Objectives

**Source data:** EIA Form 860 (update to 2025 vintage — current code uses 2024), 3,875 operable generators across ERCOT, CAISO, PJM.

**The 8 dimensions with default (Risk-Adjusted) weights:**

| # | Dimension | Weight | Data source |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Curtailment | 22% | Real neg-price % from ERCOT CDR 13060/13061 (28+ months); CAISO OASIS PRC_LMP; PJM pjm_node_stats (<0.5% neg-price historically) |
| 2 | Congestion | 18% | DA price basis vs hub from real monthly CDR/OASIS data. Queue assignment: haversine nearest-neighbour EIA plant → queue project |
| 3 | Basis Risk | 15% | DA spread: node vs reference hub, from real CDR/OASIS data |
| 4 | Capture Price | 12% | CDR hub DA monthly averages × technology timing ratio (solar diurnal, wind nocturnal, storage spread) |
| 5 | Market Revenue | 10% | MW × CF × capture price × 8,760h |
| 6 | Capacity | 10% | Nameplate MW |
| 7 | Interconnect Risk | 8% | Real queue depth (MW of competing projects) in EIA sub-BA zone — ERCOT GIS Report + CAISO public ISO data |
| 8 | RECs/Yr | 5% | Annual MWh (nameplate × CF) × regional REC price ($3–7/MWh ERCOT, $10–15/MWh CAISO) |

**Scores:** 0–100 per dimension (100 = best). Composite = weighted sum by active objective. Weights vary by objective preset.

**6 investment objective presets:** Risk-Adjusted Value, Lowest LCOE, Corporate Load Hedge, Decarbonisation, Capacity Value, Merchant/Developer Upside. Each reweights the 8 dimensions. Computed client-side as weighted dot product on normalized scores.

**Key assumptions (from app UI):**
- Universe: EIA 860 operable generators >1 MW across ERCOT (ERCO), CAISO (CISO), and PJM balancing authorities
- Capture Price = hub DA monthly average × technology timing ratio
- Mkt Revenue = MW × CF × capture price × 8,760h
- RECs/Yr = annual MWh × market REC price
- Interconnect Risk: powered by real queue depth by zone (not synthetic estimates)

**Use cases documented in app:**
- Developer/Originator: lowest curtailment + congestion → Risk-Adjusted, filter ERCOT + Wind
- PE/Fund Manager: best capture price + lowest basis risk → Lowest LCOE, filter CAISO + Solar
- IPP: queue depth by zone → sort by Congestion dimension
- Investor/Analyst: high RECs + low curtailment for ESG → Decarbonisation, filter by RECs/Yr score

## 7. Heat Rate Options — Bachelier vs Black-Scholes

**Why Bachelier:** Spark spread `P − HR × G` can go negative. Black-Scholes (log-normal) breaks for negative forwards. Bachelier (normal distribution) handles negatives — ISDA-recommended for spread options.

**Formula:** `C = e^{-rT} [ F·Φ(d) + σ√T·φ(d) ]` where `d = F/(σ√T)`

**Vol input:** `σ_abs` = annualised std dev of monthly first-differences `ΔS_t = S_t − S_{t-1}` of spark spread. NOT log-returns (undefined when spread crosses zero).

**Current calibration:** HB_NORTH vol at HR=9 ≈ $35/MWh annualised (~169% implied vol). Consistent with ERCOT Winter Storm tail risk.

---

## 8. Generator Stack / Merit Order

**Correction: Includes ALL generator types, not just thermal.** Separate tabs/buttons for: Gas, Solar, Wind, Biomass, and others. Merit-order dispatch applies primarily to dispatchable (thermal) units; renewables shown with their capacity factor profiles.

**Data sources (use 2025 vintage where available):**
- EIA Form 860 Schedule 3: design heat rates in MMBtu/MWh — **update to 2025 survey**
- FERC Form 1 O&M allocations: VOM costs
- EPA CAMPD CEMS: CO₂ intensity = actual emissions ÷ net generation

**Known limitation:** Pure economic dispatch ignores unit commitment (min run times, startup costs, ramp rates). Labelled as "simplified merit-order model" in UI.

**Key finding at current Henry Hub (~$2.50–$3/MMBtu):**
CCGT HR 6,500–7,000 BTU/MWh → marginal cost ~$16–21/MWh.
Coal/lignite HR >12,000 BTU/MWh → uneconomic above ~$1.50/MMBtu.

---

## 9. PPA & VPPA NPV Calculator — P10/P50/P90 Monte Carlo

**Correction: Calculator covers both PPAs (physical/financial) and VPPAs (financial only).** Not VPPA-only.
**Also includes CapEx modelling** so a developer can see complete forward outlook: CapEx + OpEx when valuing a deal or project.

**Structure:** VPPA = financial (Walmart pays fixed strike, receives/pays LMP − strike). PPA = physical or financial delivery at agreed price.

**Model (`GET /api/ppa-npv`):**
- Price path: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (not GBM — OU produces negatives while mean-reverting). ERCOT negative prices occur ~8–12% of hours in West zone. GBM can't model this.
- Curtailment: % reduction from zone+tech scoring data
- Degradation: 0.5%/yr solar, 0.1%/yr wind (NREL ATB — use 2025/2026 vintage)
- P10/P50/P90: 1,000 simulation paths

**ITC/PTC in `computeFinancials()`:**
- `itcValueM` = 0.30 × total CapEx (IRA domestic content adder available)
- `ptcNpvM` = $27.5/MWh × projected generation × discount factor (10yr)
- `lcoeMwh` = (CapEx × FCR + OpEx) / (annual MWh × CF)

---

## 10. Data Verification Protocol

**Run immediately after each seeder completes. Do not skip.**

| Dataset | Verification query | Expected |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| SCED dispatch | `SELECT date, rows_inserted FROM ercot_dispatch_seed_log ORDER BY date` | No nulls, rows_inserted > 100 for in-window dates |
| Nodal prices | `SELECT year, month, COUNT(DISTINCT node) FROM ercot_node_stats GROUP BY 1,2` | ~1,108 nodes per month |
| Bus locations | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ercot_buses WHERE lat IS NULL OR lon IS NULL` | 0 rows |
| Queue data | `SELECT market, COUNT(*) FROM queue_projects GROUP BY market` | ERCOT ~2k+, CAISO ~2,433 |
| DA/RT hub prices | `SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(datetime), MAX(datetime) FROM ercot_hub_prices` | Continuous date range, no gaps > 1 day |

**Spot-check protocol:** For each newly seeded dataset, pick 3 known reference points from the source (e.g. ERCOT website shows HB_NORTH DA price on a specific date) and verify they match within rounding tolerance. Log the spot-check date and values.

---

## 11. Data Analytics Tab (formerly "Data Quality")

**Tab name: "Data Analytics"** — shows all data sources by market: ERCOT, CAISO, PJM (if available).

Content includes:
- Table of all data sources: name, type, vintage, rows, last updated, source URL
- Online resource links for each market (ERCOT CDR, CAISO OASIS, EIA, FERC, etc.)
- Data completeness indicators (% of expected rows populated)

---

## 12. Methodology / Use Cases / Assumptions Sections

Most important tabs include a 3-part card section at the bottom of the page:
1. **What This Tool Does** (left) — describes the feature, data sources used, what outputs mean
2. **Use Cases** (centre) — 3–4 named personas (Developer/Originator, PE/Fund Manager, IPP, Investor/Analyst) with specific workflow examples
3. **Key Assumptions** (right) — per-dimension or per-model assumptions, data vintage, known limitations

This pattern is confirmed on the Rankings page and several others. **When adding new pages or features, add this 3-card section.** It is critical UX — the platform has many features and without this context users (and the dev after a week) forget how things work.

**Pages confirmed to have this section:** Rankings, (others to be verified)
**Pages that may need it added:** Any new pages built during AWS migration

---

## 13. Regulatory & Tax Data — Keeping It Current

Regulatory/IRA/tax credit data requires **active maintenance**. Strategy:
- ERCOT and CAISO publish rule changes on their websites on an ad hoc basis — need to monitor
- IRA provisions (ITC/PTC rates, domestic content adders, transferability) can change with legislation
- External links (FERC orders, IRS guidance, ISO tariffs) should be verified periodically
- Consider a lightweight "last verified" timestamp on each `regulatory_items` row so stale entries are visible

**To-do:** Design a process for periodic regulatory refresh — ideally quarterly, or when a major rule change is announced.

---

## Summary: Recurring Themes

1. **Public energy APIs have silent failure modes** — validate output size, row counts, and completeness; never trust HTTP 200.
2. **Scale requires memory-per-record thinking early** — ZIP64 parsing, page-size tuning, bulk insert batching all needed to go from 100 nodes to 1,100 nodes. Use Polars, not Pandas.
3. **Financial models need domain-appropriate assumptions** — Bachelier vs Black-Scholes, OU vs GBM, weighted capture prices vs hub averages separate a credible energy analytics tool from a generic dashboard.
4. **Verify data at seed time, not later** — immediate spot-checks against source prevent silent data quality issues from compounding.
5. **Use 2025/2026 data vintages** — 2024 EIA/NREL/ERCOT reports are now stale.
